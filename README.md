# My custom Marp themes

[Marp](https://marp.app/) is used to create presentations in Markdown. In this repository, you may find simple CSS themes that I have created. Namely:

- `beam`, based on [LaTeX's beamer class](https://github.com/josephwright/beamer)
  - download the [Computer Modern Unicode font family](https://ctan.org/pkg/cm-unicode?lang=en) for best results
  - follow the [tutorial](how-to/beam_custom.md) to change the primary colors

![beam sample](./samples/beam.png)

- `border`, based on the `default` Marp theme

- `gradient`, also based on the `default` Marp theme

- `gradient`, class `blue`
